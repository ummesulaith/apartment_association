Apartment providing services to the residents
Though there are many services offered by an apartment, there are some
situations where these Services also consume more effort of users in today's
high-tech world where every job of a person is made to be ease. So to overcome
such situations where manpower can be reduced, we have come up with these
android app.
Thus it eliminates the need to visit the actual place multiple times for the
maintenance. Thus transparency can be achived.


The objective is to design and develop mobile app for the apartment with
services of limited cost and less time.

and linking it to the services at the simple call.

It also manages various events at the community ,also addresses complaints
encountered by occupants , provides buy and sell is feature that enables selling
and buying goods within the society.
